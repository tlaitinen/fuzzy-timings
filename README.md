fuzzy-timings
=============

A Haskell package to translate high-level timing definitions, e.g. play this commercial 10 times / hour between 9am - 11am, to simpler definitions

The original use case of this package is to implement "media planning" in
retail stores, that is, what should be played and when.  Accurately scheduled
announcements, fuzzily scheduled commercials and store opening hours are taken
into account.
